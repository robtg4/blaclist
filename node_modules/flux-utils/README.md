# Flux Utils

Pardon the dust, quickly hacking away at this to make it OSS / Release worthy. Intended use: a util library to facilitate in creating Flux Stores with ease. (More info to come)

**Early adopters**, careful with breaking changes as the versions rev quickly in early stages.


## TODO
- expose `store.dispatchToken` for use with `#waitFor()`
- write more tests (or fill in the todos)
- finish this readme, include some examples for usage
- some other things I'm probably not thinking of
- oh, a changelog would be nice to keep


## Capacitor Quick Start

`npm install flux-utils`

```js
// myStore.js
import Capacitor from 'flux-capacitors'

let actionHandlers = {};
actionHandlers[MY_CONST_ACTION_TYPE] = function myConstActionTypeHandler (action) {
    // process action, emit change (only if necessary)
    MyStore.emitchange();
};

let MyStore = Capacitor({ actionHandlers }, MyFluxDispatcher);
```

## Mixin Quick Start

`npm install flux-utils`

```js
// myComponent.js
import { Mixin as Capacitors } from 'flux-capacitors'

var ReactComponent = React.createClass({
    mixins: [Capacitors],
    listenTo: [MyCapacitorStore],
    render () {
        // #wheee
    }
})
```
